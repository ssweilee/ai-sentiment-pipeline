# AI Sentiment Pipeline

Serverless backend for processing audience sentiment & trend analysis data. Built with AWS Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, and integrated with AWS Bedrock for NLP.

## Key Features
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Uses AWS SQS for scalable, non-blocking message handling.
- **Serverless Compute:** AWS Lambda functions for data fetching, analysis, and aggregation.
- **AI/NLP Integration:** Sentiment analysis and trend extraction using AWS Bedrock.
- **Reliable Storage:** Results stored in S3 and DynamoDB for easy retrieval.
- **Automated Deployment:** CI/CD with AWS Amplify.
